# Hello WOrld

This repo is a way of learning Haskell through excercises in the following materials:
- Hakell Programming from First Principles
- Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming 
- Various CTF's (Capture the Flag's) and solving the solutions using Haskell

It is also a way to create refferences and documentation for myself as I learn and develop more skills.
