# Hello World

This repo is a way of learning Haskell through excercises on the following materials:
- Haskell Programming from First Principles
- Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming 
- Various CTF's (Capture the Flag's) and solving the solutions using Haskell

It is also a way to create references and documentation for myself as I learn and develop more skills.
Feel free to browse, this is a more personal type of repo with numerous aspects and the goal of being a programming playground. 
Any projects worth displaying will have its own Repo
